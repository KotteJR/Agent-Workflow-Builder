## Introduction

This Commission Notice (2017/C 393/05) provides guidance on the application of the principle of quantitative ingredient declaration (QUID - Quantitative Ingredient Declaration) within the framework of Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011.

The notice aims to provide guidance to:
- Food businesses
- National authorities

and replaces the previous guidance adopted under Directive 79/112/EEC.

## Obligation for Quantitative Ingredient Declaration

### General Principles

Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 requires the declaration of the quantity of certain ingredients or categories of ingredients used in the manufacture or processing of all **pre-packed foods**.

### Exceptions

Quantitative ingredient declaration **does not apply** in the following cases:

1. **Foods with Single Ingredient**: The quantity automatically corresponds to 100%

2. **Non-pre-packed Foods**: 
   - Foods offered without packaging
   - Foods packaged at the point of sale at the customer's request
   - Products pre-packaged for immediate sale
   - (Unless member states have adopted national rules)

3. **Special Cases**: As defined in Annex VIII of the Regulation

4. **Naturally Contained Elements**: 
   - Caffeine in coffee
   - Vitamins and mineral substances in fruit juices
   - (Have not been added as ingredients)

## Criteria for Quantitative Declaration

### Article 22 Paragraph 1 of the Regulation

Declaration of the quantity of an ingredient or category of ingredients is required when:

#### a) Appearance in Food Name

The ingredient appears in the food name **or** is normally associated by the consumer with the food name.

**Examples requiring QUID:**
- "Pizza with ham and mushrooms" → Ham, mushrooms
- "Strawberry yogurt" → Strawberry
- "Salmon mousse" → Salmon
- "Chocolate ice cream" → Chocolate
- "Vegetable pie" → Total vegetable content
- "Fish croquettes" → Total fish content

**Examples with ingredient categories:**
- Bread with dried fruit → Dried fruit
- Fruit tart → Fruit

### Compound Ingredients

For compound ingredients, the following rules apply:

#### Situation 1: Compound ingredient in the name
E.g. "Biscuits with cream filling"
→ **Required**: Quantitative declaration of cream filling ingredients

#### Situation 2: Ingredient of compound ingredient in the name
E.g. "Biscuits with cream filling containing eggs"
→ **Required**: Quantitative declaration for eggs, in addition to the cream filling

### b) Clear Distinction on Label

Declaration of quantity is required when the ingredient is clearly distinguished on the label by:
- Words
- Images
- Graphic representation

**Examples:**
- "With chicken"
- "Made with butter"
- "With cream"
- Different font size/color
- Photograph or illustration of specific ingredients
- Image indicating origin (e.g., cow image for dairy)

**Presentations NOT requiring QUID:**
- Photograph of the food as sold
- "Serving suggestion"
- Image representing all ingredients without focus on one
- Image showing preparation/serving method

### c) Essential Significance for Characterization

Declaration of quantity is required when the ingredient has essential significance for:
- Characterization of the food
- Distinction from similar products

This applies particularly when foods are described with **common names** without descriptive details.

## Examples of Common Names

| Common Name | Descriptive Name | Required QUID |
|---|---|---|
| Lancashire hot pot | Beef with potatoes, onions, carrots | Beef |
| Chilli con carne | Ground beef with beans, tomatoes, peppers | Ground beef |
| Forloren skildpadde | Beef with meatballs | Beef |
| Boudoir | Biscuits with eggs | Eggs |

## Exceptions from QUID Declaration

**Not necessary** to declare ingredient quantity for:

- Apples in apple juice (confusion with product name)
- Dry ham (no automatic obligation for similar products to declare meat)

## Forms of Expression

Quantitative ingredient declaration can be expressed as:
- Percentage by weight (%)
- Absolute quantity
- Per case basis

## Position on Label

QUID must be placed:
- In the ingredient list or
- Near the food name
- Visible and legible

## Interpretation and Application

Important interpretation principles:

1. **Case-by-case assessment**: No automatic obligation for every name

2. **Reasonableness**: Logic should be used in relation to expected composition

3. **Consumer-centric standard**: Based on what consumers typically associate with the product
