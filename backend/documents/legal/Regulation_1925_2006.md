### 2. Non-Application to Food Supplements

The provisions of this Regulation concerning vitamins and mineral substances shall not apply to food supplements covered by Directive 2002/46/EC.

### 3. Application with Exceptions

This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the specific provisions laid down in Community legislation on:

**a)** Foods intended for particular nutritional uses and, where specific provisions do not exist, the composition requirements of such products deemed necessary on account of the particular nutritional requirements of the persons for whom they are intended

**b)** Novel foods and novel food ingredients

**c)** Genetically modified foods

**d)** Food additives and flavouring substances

**e)** Authorised oenological practices and processes

## ARTICLE 2 - Definitions

For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:

**"Authority"** means the European Food Safety Authority established by Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of January 28, 2002, for the establishment of the general principles and requirements of food law, for the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority and the determination of procedures in food safety matters.

**"Other substance"** means a substance other than vitamins or mineral substances which produces a nutritional or physiological effect.

## CHAPTER II - ADDITION OF VITAMINS AND MINERAL SUBSTANCES

## ARTICLE 3 - Requirements for the Addition of Vitamins and Mineral Substances

### 1. Authorized Additions

Subject to the rules of this Regulation, only vitamins or mineral substances listed in Annex I may be added to foods, in the forms listed in Annex II.

### 2. Conditions for Addition

Vitamins and mineral substances in bioavailable form may be added to foods, whether or not they are normally contained in the foods in question, taking into account in particular:

**a)** The absence of one or more vitamins or mineral substances in the population or in specific population groups, which may be demonstrated by clinical or subclinical evidence of deficiency or which is indicated by estimated low nutrient intake levels

**b)** The possibility of improving the nutritional status of the population or of specific population groups and/or meeting potential inadequate intakes of vitamins or mineral substances due to changes in dietary habits

**c)** The evolution in the generally accepted scientific knowledge as to the role played by vitamins and minerals in nutrition and the related effects on health

### 3. Modifications to Lists

Modifications to the lists referred to in paragraph 1 shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 14(3), taking into account the opinion of the Authority.

For reasons of urgency, the Commission may apply the urgent procedure provided for in Article 14(4) to withdraw or add a vitamin or mineral substance to the lists referred to in paragraph 1.

Before making such modifications, the Commission shall consult the interested parties, in particular food industry bodies and consumer associations.

## ARTICLE 4 - Restrictions on the Addition of Vitamins and Mineral Substances

Vitamins and mineral substances may not be added to:

**a)** Unprocessed products, including inter alia fruit, vegetables, meat and fish

**b)** Beverages containing more than 1.2% alcohol by volume, with the exception, and by way of derogation from Article 3(2), of the products:

provided that no nutrition or health claim is made.

Additional restrictions on the addition of specific vitamins and mineral substances to certain other foods or food categories shall be determined in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 14(3), taking into account scientific evidence and the nutritional value of such foods.

## ARTICLE 5 - Purity Criteria

### 1. Delegation of Authority

Measures determining the purity criteria for vitamin preparations and mineral substances listed in Annex II, which modify non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 14(3), unless paragraph 2 of this Article applies.

### 2. Application of Existing Standards

For the vitamin preparations and mineral substances listed in Annex II, the purity criteria provided for in Community legislation for their use in food preparation for purposes other than those of this Regulation shall apply.

### 3. Generally Accepted Criteria

For the vitamin preparations and mineral substances listed in Annex II for which purity criteria are not laid down in Community legislation and until relevant specifications are established, generally accepted purity criteria recommended by international organisations shall apply, and Member States may maintain national rules laying down stricter purity criteria.
