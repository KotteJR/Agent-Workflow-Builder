## DEFINITIONS

### Food Additive

A food additive means any substance not normally consumed as a food in itself and not normally used as a characteristic ingredient of food, whether or not it has nutritive value, the intentional addition of which to food for a technological purpose in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or holding of that food results, or may be reasonably expected to result, in it or its byproducts becoming a direct or indirect constituent of the food.
