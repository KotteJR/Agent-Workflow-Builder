## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this notice is to assist businesses and national authorities in implementing the new requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and Council regarding the indication of the presence of certain substances or products causing allergies or intolerances [Article 9 paragraph 1 point (c) and Annex II of the Regulation].

Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers establishes new requirements regarding the labeling of allergens compared to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and Council.

Specifically, under the new legislation, information about the presence of allergens in foods must be provided to consumers at all times, including in non-pre-packaged foods (Article 9 paragraph 1 point (c) and Article 44). However, Member States are permitted to establish national measures regarding the method of providing allergen information in non-pre-packaged foods. Regarding pre-packaged foods, the Regulation specifies the detailed method of providing allergen information in foods (Article 21). Consequently, the existing guidelines for allergen labeling, which were drawn up under the framework of Directive 2000/13/EC, should be updated to reflect this change in legislation.

This notice does not affect the interpretation that may be provided by the Court of Justice of the European Union.

## 2. List of Allergens (Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011)

Annex II of the Regulation includes a list of substances or products contained in foods and cause allergies or intolerances. This list was prepared based on scientific opinions issued by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

Within the framework of Annex II, the following should be noted:

- **Cereals**: The cereals listed in Annex II point 1 should be considered as an exhaustive list.

- **Eggs**: The eggs in Annex II point 3 refer to eggs from farmed birds of any species.

- **Milk**: The milk in Annex II point 7 refers to milk from the mammary gland of farmed animals.

- **Tree Nuts**: The tree nuts listed in Annex II point 8 should be considered as an exhaustive list.

- **Derivatives**: Annex II lists not only substances and products as such but also products derived from them. If microorganisms are fed on a substrate that constitutes a food ingredient included in Annex II, such microorganisms should not be considered products derived from such substrates.

## 3. Detailed Method of Providing Allergen Information in Pre-Packaged Foods

### (Specifically Article 21 in combination with Article 18 of the Regulation)

#### 3.1. When the food has an ingredients list

According to Article 21 paragraph 1 point (a):

> "Subject to the rules laid down pursuant to Article 44 paragraph 2, the information provided for in Article 9 paragraph 1 point (c) shall meet the following requirements:
> (a) they are listed in the ingredients list in accordance with the rules of Article 18 paragraph 1, with a clear reference to the name of the substance or product as included in Annex II; [...]"

**Cereals containing gluten**: When ingredients are produced from cereals containing gluten listed in Annex II, they must be declared with a name that contains a clear reference to the specific type of cereal, namely wheat, rye, barley, or oats.

**Example**: Barley vinegar, oat flakes.

**Special wheat varieties**: When using spelt, Khorasan wheat, or durum wheat, there must be a clear reference to the specific type of cereal, meaning wheat must be written. The word wheat may be accompanied by the word "durum," "spelt," or "Khorasan," added optionally.

**Example**: Wheat or wheat (durum) or durum wheat, wheat or wheat (spelt) or spelt wheat.

The indication of the specific type of cereal may be accompanied by the word "gluten," added optionally.

**Example**: Wheat flour (contains gluten) or wheat flour (gluten).

**Pure gluten**: When gluten is added as such, as an ingredient, the type of cereal from which the gluten is derived must be declared.

**Example**: Gluten (wheat), wheat gluten, or gluten (from wheat); dextrin (wheat) or (wheat gluten); dextrin (contains wheat) or (contains wheat gluten).

**Gluten-free claims**: When a product containing one of the cereals mentioned in Annex II (e.g., oats) meets the relevant requirements of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 828/2014, the product may use the claim "gluten-free" or "very low gluten content." However, the cereal mentioned in Annex II must in this case also be listed and emphasized in the ingredients list in accordance with Articles 9 and 21 of the Regulation.

**Tree nuts**: Regarding tree nuts, the specific type listed in Annex II point 8 must be stated in the ingredients list, namely almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashew nuts, pecan nuts, Brazil nuts, pistachios, or macadamia nuts. When ingredients or food processing aids derive from tree nuts listed in Annex II, the ingredient must be declared with a clear reference to the specific name of the tree nut.

**Example**: Seasoning (almond).

#### Highlighting allergens

According to Article 21 paragraph 1 point (b):

> "[...] (b) the name of the substance or product as included in Annex II is emphasized by a type of character that makes a clear distinction of the name from the rest of the ingredients list, for example through the font, style, or background color".

Article 21 paragraph 1 point (b) provides some flexibility regarding the method of emphasis, for example through font, style, or background color. It is up to the food business operator to choose the appropriate method of distinguishing each allergen from the other ingredients in the list. However, some clarifications are needed regarding the information that must be emphasized.

**Partial names**: When the name of an ingredient consists of several separate words (e.g., in French "poudre de lait," "milk powder"), it is sufficient to emphasize only the word that corresponds to the substance/product listed in Annex II. When the allergen name is part of an ingredient name in a single word (e.g., in German "Milchpulver," "milk powder"), it is sufficient to emphasize the part of the ingredient name that corresponds to the substance/product listed in Annex II.

**Compound ingredients**: If a compound ingredient contains substances causing allergies or intolerances listed in Annex II, these substances must be emphasized in the ingredients list.

**Example**: For a banana cream containing egg yolk, strawberry, sugar, water, [...], the word "egg" must be emphasized. For a sandwich with mayonnaise containing eggs, the presence of "eggs" must be emphasized.

#### 3.2. When the food does not have an ingredients list

Article 21 paragraph 1 second subparagraph states:

> "If there is no ingredients list, the indication of the information provided for in Article 9 paragraph 1 point (c) includes the word 'contains', followed by the name of the substance or product as included in Annex II".

**Exception for foods used as ingredients**: When foods excluded from the requirement to carry an ingredients list (such as wine) are used as an ingredient in the production or preparation of another food that has an ingredients list, the presence of allergens in such foods must be emphasized so they stand out from the other ingredients in the list (Article 21 paragraph 1 applies).

**Example**: Ingredients: ... wine (contains sulfites), with the word "sulfites" emphasized.

#### 3.3. Labeling of derivatives of the same allergen

Article 21 paragraph 1 third subparagraph states:

> "Where various ingredients or food processing aids derive from a single substance or product listed in Annex II, this shall be made clear in the labeling for each relevant ingredient or food processing aid".

For the purposes of this requirement, the reference to the substance(s) or product(s) listed in Annex II does not necessarily need to be repeated as many times as these substances are present. Any presentation that makes clear that different ingredients derive from a single substance or product included in Annex II meets the requirement and is acceptable. However, the reference must be directly linked to the ingredients list, e.g., the relevant information is listed at the end of the ingredients list or very close to the ingredients list.

**Example**:
A food that includes food additives, carriers, and processing aids derived from wheat could be labeled as follows:

```
...
— Additive (1)
— Additive (1)
— Carrier (1)
— Processing aid (1)
— ...
(1) from wheat (with the word "wheat" emphasized).
```

#### 3.4. Exception

Article 21 paragraph 1 final subparagraph states:

> "The indication of the information referred to in Article 9 paragraph 1 point (c) shall not be required in cases where the name of the food clearly refers to the substance or product in question".

According to this requirement, when a food is sold under a name such as "cheese" or "cream," which clearly refers to one of the allergens listed in Annex II (e.g., milk) and the food is not required to carry an ingredients list in accordance with Article 19 paragraph 1 point (d) of the Regulation, the specific allergen need not be declared on the label.

However, if the food is sold under a trade name/commercial name that does not clearly refer to one of the allergens in Annex II, the commercial name should be accompanied by additional information that "clearly refers to" the relevant allergen, as required by Article 21 paragraph 1 final subparagraph.

**Example**:
"Ambert" (as the name of the food) together with "rustic blue cheese" (as text that complements the food name and is listed very close to the food name), where the word cheese is the clear reference to the substance in Annex II.

Because consumer understanding of such food names may differ from one Member State to another, case-by-case assessment is necessary.

**With ingredients list**: If the food name clearly refers to one of the allergens listed in Annex II and there is an ingredients list for that food (on either an optional or mandatory basis), the allergen present in the food must be emphasized in the ingredients list.

**Example**: "Cheese (milk, salt, rennet, ...)", with the word milk emphasized.

**Multiple allergens**: If the food name clearly refers to a substance or product in Annex II but the product contains other substances or products in Annex II, those allergens must be declared so that consumers can make informed choices about foods that are safe for them.

#### 3.5. Optional repetition

Except for existing Union provisions applicable to specific foods, allergen information cannot be optionally repeated outside the ingredients list; nor can the word "contains" be used followed by the name of the substance or product listed in Annex II; nor can symbols or boxes with text be used (see recital 47, Article 21 paragraph 1 in combination with Article 36 paragraph 1 of the Regulation).

## 4. Allergen Information in Non-Pre-Packaged Foods

Article 44 of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 states:

> "1. For foods offered for sale to the final consumer or to mass catering facilities without pre-packaging or foods packaged at the point of sale at the buyer's request, or pre-packaged for direct sale,
> (a) the provision of the information defined in Article 9 paragraph 1 point (c) is mandatory;
> [...]
> 2. Member States may lay down national measures concerning the manner in which the indications or elements of the indications defined in paragraph 1 are to be provided and, where appropriate, the form of expression and presentation of these indications".

The Regulation provides for mandatory provision of allergen information in non-pre-packaged foods.

**Member State discretion**: Member States, however, retain the authority to establish national provisions regarding the manner in which allergen information is provided in such foods. In principle, all means of communication are permitted regarding the provision of allergen information so that consumers can make informed choices, e.g., label, other accompanying material, or any other means, such as modern technology tools or oral announcements (i.e., verifiable oral information).

**Absence of national measures**: If no such national measures are established, the provisions of the Regulation for pre-packaged foods also apply to non-pre-packaged foods. Therefore, in accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation, allergen information must be easily visible, legible, and, as appropriate, indelible and provided in written form. For this reason, it is not possible to provide allergen information only when the consumer requests it. Furthermore, the labeling requirements defined in Article 21 of the Regulation (points 3-21 above) apply.

## 5. Update of Annex II

Article 21 paragraph 2 of the Regulation states:

> "In order to ensure better information for consumers and to take into account the latest scientific advances and technical knowledge, the Commission shall systematically review and, if necessary, update the list in Annex II by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 51.
> [...]".

**Updating the allergen list**: The update of the list in Annex II may consist of adding a substance to the list or removing a substance from it. Regarding the removal from the list of food allergens, Directive 2000/13/EC provided special provisions under which interested parties could submit to the Commission studies demonstrating that for certain allergens it has been scientifically proven that it is impossible for them to cause adverse reactions. These special provisions have not been retained in the Regulation. However, this fact does not prevent potentially interested parties from notifying the Commission of information demonstrating that products derived from substances listed in Annex II are not likely, under certain conditions, to cause adverse reactions in individuals.

**Submission procedure**: Such information can be prepared in accordance with the EFSA document "Guidance on the preparation and presentation of applications pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 11 of Directive 2000/13/EC" and can be sent to the Commission in at least two copies on an electronic medium (CD or memory stick) to the following address:

> Directorate General for Health and Food Safety, Unit E1
> European Commission
> 1049 Bruxelles/Brussel
> BELGIQUE/BELGIË
