# REGULATION (EC) No. 1924/2006

**Date:** December 20, 2006

**Subject:** On nutrition and health claims made on foods

## PREAMBLE

The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, acting under the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community, particularly Article 95, have established this Regulation to harmonize the rules governing nutrition and health claims made on foods.

### Key Objectives

This Regulation aims to:

- Ensure a high level of consumer protection
- Facilitate consumer choice through clear and accurate labeling
- Establish uniform rules across the EU market
- Prevent misleading claims about food safety or health effects
- Harmonize national provisions that could hinder the free movement of foods

## CHAPTER I - SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE

## ARTICLE 1 - Subject Matter

This Regulation establishes rules for nutrition and health claims made on foods, whether they are made in commercial communications including advertising or on labeling, in order to ensure:

- A high level of protection for consumers
- The provision of information enabling consumers to make informed choices
- Fair competition in the food industry

## ARTICLE 2 - Scope

### Application

This Regulation applies to:

- **Nutrition claims:** Any claim that states, suggests, or implies that a food has particular nutritional properties
- **Health claims:** Any claim that states, suggests, or implies that a relationship exists between a food or one of its constituents and health

### Non-Application

This Regulation shall not apply to:

- Non-commercial statements or communications
- Published scientific literature
- Dietary guidelines issued by public health authorities
- Descriptions of common food use
- Traditional or generic descriptors (e.g., "digestive" or "cough drops")

## DEFINITIONS

### Nutrition Claim

A nutrition claim means any claim which states, suggests or implies that a food has particular beneficial nutritional properties due to:

- The energy (calorific value) it provides
- The nutrients it contains
- The nutrients it does not contain or contains in reduced form
- Nutrient content relative to other foods

### Health Claim

A health claim means any claim which states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists between a food category, a food, or one of its constituents and health, including claims of disease prevention or risk reduction.

## ANNEX - PERMITTED NUTRITION CLAIMS

### 1. ENERGY CONTENT CLAIMS

#### Low Energy
A claim that a food is low in energy, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the product contains no more than 40 kcal (170 kJ) per 100 g for solids or 20 kcal (80 kJ) per 100 ml for liquids.

#### Energy-Free
A claim that a food is energy-free, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the product contains no more than 4 kcal (17 kJ) per 100 ml.

### 2. FAT CONTENT CLAIMS

#### Low Fat
A claim that a food is low in fat, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the fat content does not exceed:

- 3 g per 100 g for solids
- 1.5 g per 100 ml for liquids

#### Fat-Free
A claim that a food is fat-free, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the product contains no more than 0.5 g of fat per 100 g or 100 ml.

#### Reduced Fat
A claim that a food has reduced fat content, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the fat content is reduced by at least 30% compared to a similar food, except where fat reduction is achieved by increased water content.

### 3. SATURATED FAT CLAIMS

#### Low Saturated Fat
A claim that a food is low in saturated fat, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where:

- The sum of saturated fat and trans fat does not exceed 1.5 g per 100 g for solids or 0.75 g per 100 ml for liquids
- Saturated fat does not exceed 10% of energy value

#### Reduced Saturated Fat
A claim that a food has reduced saturated fat, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where:

- The sum of saturated fat and trans fat is reduced by at least 30%
- The trans fat content is not increased

### 4. SODIUM/SALT CLAIMS

#### Low Sodium/Salt
A claim that a food is low in sodium or salt, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the sodium content does not exceed:

- 120 mg per 100 g for solids
- 120 mg per 100 ml for liquids

#### Sodium-Free/Salt-Free
A claim that a food is sodium-free or salt-free, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the sodium content does not exceed 5 mg per 100 g or 100 ml.

#### Reduced Sodium/Salt
A claim that a food has reduced sodium or salt, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the sodium content is reduced by at least 25% compared to a similar food.

### 5. SUGAR CLAIMS

#### Low Sugar
A claim that a food is low in sugar, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the sugar content does not exceed 5 g per 100 g for solids or 2.5 g per 100 ml for liquids.

#### Sugar-Free
A claim that a food is sugar-free, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the sugar content does not exceed 0.5 g per 100 g or 100 ml.

#### Reduced Sugar
A claim that a food has reduced sugar, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the sugar content is reduced by at least 30% compared to a similar food.

### 6. PROTEIN CLAIMS

#### High Protein Content
The claim that a food is high in protein, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where at least 20% of the energy value of the food is provided by protein.

#### Source of Protein
The claim that a food is a source of protein, or any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be used where the product contains at least a significant amount of protein as defined in Annex to Directive 90/496/EEC.
